    <p>
      Living in NÃ¦rum with my wife Louise and my daughter Hannah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifetime learner and polyglot software craftsman with a great love for physical training, music and nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long experience implementing and teaching agile methodologies and principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over 19 years of experience on software development, I span a variety of different technologies, paradigms and programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had many roles within and outside IT, such as developer, coach, teacher, architect, project manager, scrum master, product owner and team lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I still do software development, I keep up with new technologies and therefore thrive in environentments and cultures who value competences, innovation and creativity.
